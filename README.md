# BERT_Fine_Tuning_Sentence_Classification_v2
I use [The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)] dataset for single sentence classification. It's a set of sentences labeled as grammatically correct or incorrect
The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) in its full form consists of 10657 sentences from 23 linguistics publications, expertly annotated for acceptability (grammaticality) by their original authors. The public version provided here contains 9594 sentences belonging to training and development sets, and excludes 1063 sentences belonging to a held out test set.
I used BERT with the huggingface PyTorch library to quickly and efficiently fine-tune a model to get near state of the art performance in sentence classification.
